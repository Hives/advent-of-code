This one involved running an opcode program to find certain values out of a
range of 11111111111111 to 99999999999999.

It's much too slow to actually run the program, so you have to solve it by
inspecting the program and working out what it does.

Maybe I'll come back and fill in more details here? Hint - it helps to think 
about the contents of the z register as being in base 26.

Part 1 (max value) was 29989297949519
Part 2 (min value) was 19518121316118
