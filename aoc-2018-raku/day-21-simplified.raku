solution:

from the translated version of the program in this file, we can see that the
program generates a sequence of numbers in register 1 ($b), and if it is equal
to the value in register 0 ($a) it ends. (line 40).

so letting the program run and printing out all the values of $b which are used
for the check on line 40 gives all the possible values of $a which will cause the
program to terminate.

the value for part 1 is the first value of $b at this point, the value for part 2
is the last value of $b before it starts to loop.
